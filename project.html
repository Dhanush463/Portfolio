                            <p class="des" style="display:none;">Due to India’s very high population and its direct proportional increase in the quantity of garbage and lack of new land for landfill, there is a very big need for bringing a smart system for garbage collection and management. Using IOT and a smart garbage processor at the ward level will increase the efficiency of the existing system. IoT usage in Waste Management is still in research level. Using Internet and spending a major portion of budget for this infrastructure change may seems to be a luxury for a developing country like India. But to avoid dangerous health hazards for the future generation, bringing this infrastructure change with additional budget amount for waste management is must and inevitable. Any infrastructure can be converted into IoT enabled by making small changes in the equipment used in the existing system. The existing bins kept in the major streets of the city can be easily converted into IoT by implanting sensors and internet connectivity unit. The proposal can be divided into two major levels. In the first level, the aim is to design a smart bin with three sections. One for bio degradable domestic waste, the second for inert debris (soiled diapers and sanitary napkins) and the third for non-bio degradable wastes. If the IoT is used for waste management, it will be easy to monitor all the smart bins and hence the number of trips of heavy vehicles and small vehicles can be reduced. By using the proposed model, the health problems faced by the corporation workers and scavengers can be reduced.</p>

                            <p class="des1" style="display: none;">At present female participation in the work force in the industrialized nations has greatly increased, thereby affecting infant care in many families. Both parents are required to work due to the high cost of living. However, they still need to look after their babies thereby increasing workload and stress, especially of the mother. Working parents cannot always care for their babies. They either send their babies to their parents or hire a baby caregiver while they are working. Some parents worry about the safety of their babies in the care of others. Thus, they go home to check on their babies during their free time, such as lunch or tea break. A baby monitoring system that can monitor the baby’s condition real time is proposed to solve these problems. A baby monitoring system consisting of a video camera and microphone without limitations of coverage. It can send data and immediately notify the parents about urgent situations, thereby shortening the time needed to handle such scenarios. </p>
